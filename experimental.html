There is something genuinely shocking to me about how highly I think of this anime.  I stumbled upon it believing it would be fun for a couple of laughs.  Yet, I feel like I have actually stumbled onto one of my favorite animes this year.  
The story begins with Houtarou, a boy with no other purpose in life but to conserve energy.  He eventually ends up joining the "Classics club", and meeting Chitanda, a girl so fascinated with all of life’s mysteries that Houtarou ends up having to find an answer to all of her curiosities.  At first, I thought this story would be a watered down Sherlock Holmes.  It's a bunch of high school kids solving small time mysteries.  Yet, as the episodes go along I found myself drawn into these little mysteries.  They don't have to over sell themselves.  These high school kids aren't trying to find a murderer or save the world from certain destruction.  They’re solving mysteries in their school, their community, their families etc.  These feel like realistic every day mysteries that most people often ignore, accepting that these little inconsistencies are just part of life.  This show has brought out the charm in the mundane.
The animation snuck up on me with the realization of how brilliant it is.  The settings and characters are average normal places and people.  On the surface they may not seem like much.  However, the amazing amount of detail put into the animation is astounding.  I rarely see animation where the animators bother to have a character change gears on his bike, let alone let the audience see the inner mechanisms of the bike reacting to the gear shift.  In another episode, the lighting changed slightly due to the setting of the sun.  Yet it changed everything about the scene.  The characters all of a sudden seemed to glow with an inner light and it changed the focus of the whole scene.  I am an art major and I have done some animating before.  It has made me realize that simple things like light changes can actually be a pretty major undertaking as well as animating the small details that most people don't notice.  Ultimately, most animators let the little things go by the way side because it’s too much effort to animate that little change in the sun, the boy changing his pencil lead, that little reflection off the window etc.  However, this anime has taken great care to animate the small actions that most take for granted.  Once again, even in the animation the creators are elevating the mundane to something almost glamorous.
<span>The voice acting is pretty wonderful in my opinion.  Each character feels distinctive to me without feeling overworked.  Anime, for me, is usually like taking the amp on real life and cranking it up to 10.  This anime doesn't do that.  It scales everything back and settles you into this world.  I feel like the voices do that really well as well as the music.  It doesn't call a lot of unnecessary attention to itself and really blends well with the scene as a whole.
The characters really grew on me.  In the beginning, the characters appeared very one dimensional and stayed that way for the first few episodes.  I had resigned myself to the characters being mediocre until they started to change.  Their personalities begin to alter in small ways that some may not notice.  However, I pay special attention to characterization so it really stuck out to me.  Now that I have finished the series, I actually went back and watched the first episode over again just to see how much the protagonist had grown.  Ultimately, this is a story of a boy who is coming to understand that he has a gift.  He has denied any sort of skill whatsoever so seeing him learn more about his own talent is actually pretty fascinating.  This is one of my favorite aspects of the series; its choice of main character.  Houtarou is very introverted and chooses not to talk to other characters about himself.  Yet, he is likeable enough that other characters end up talking more, which makes potentially boring characters more interesting.  However, since he is the main character, we also have access to his inner thoughts, giving us a deeper understanding of his character than the people around him.  Chitanda's character needed some work.  She spends a vast majority of the series feeling more like a plot device to cause drama within the story.  She is the one who, a majority of the time, forces the other characters to solve the mystery by harassing them into it.  She actually does get a lot more depth to her character, but only in the last episode.  If they had started bringing out these plot threads in the 6th or 7th episode I would have probably loved her character.  As it is, I dealt with over 20 episodes of this character and the addition of actual depth came far too late.  I am incredibly fascinated with the relationship between Houtarou and Satoshi.  The creators did an excellent job of developing a straining friendship and what it actually feels like.  Ultimately, I don't love Satoshi's character by himself.  The only part of his character that comes out in other scenes tends to be that he is an encyclopedia of facts and that he is outgoing and generally pretty positive.  But as soon as he is put in a scene with Houtarou, it becomes truely fascinating.  Houtarou simultaneously brings out the best and worst of this character, which made me absolutely love any interaction between them.
I will admit that this is not a typical anime and I can see how some people would call it boring.  There are no fight scenes.  There is no melodrama.  There aren't any villains... or heros for that matter.  What this anime does have is an appreciation for real life.  It reminds me of the days when a gust of wind will blow by and I will stop walking out of sheer joy to feel it across my face.  Like I said before, this anime appreciates normal life and focuses on everything we stopped paying attention to because we saw it every day.  This anime is perfectly summed up by Chitanda's catch phrase "I am curious!"
